## Project overview: 

The "Supporting Low Income Students in California's Community Colleges" project uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative data to assess how different facets of student supports prorams offered at California community colleges are associated with student-level outcomes. 

The research utilizes information from a survey of program coordinators from three specific programs: California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs), Extended Opportunity Programs and Services (EOPS), and Cooperative Agencies Resources for Education (CARE). The  purpose of a survey is to gauge campus-level detail regarding the capacity of services offered through these programs.
